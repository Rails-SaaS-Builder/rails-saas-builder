    # Base lifecycle handler for auth events. All methods are no-ops by default.
    # Subclass and override specific methods to hook into auth lifecycle events.
    #
    # Handler instances are stateless — a new instance is created for each invocation.
    # Do not store instance state between calls.
    #
    # Exceptions in handler methods propagate to the caller. The handler is
    # responsible for its own error handling.
    #
    # @example Subclassing in host app
    #   class MyAuthLifecycle < RSB::Auth::LifecycleHandler
